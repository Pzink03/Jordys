I am currently employed as a Foster Parent Recruiter for the state of Kentucky, having recently attained my Master's in Social Work from the University of Kentucky. While I have a passion for the social work profession, I am also enthusiastic about launching this cleaning business, where I can apply my commitment to providing exceptional customer service while pursuing my dreams and financial aspirations. My boyfriend, Pete, has been a source of inspiration for me to embark on this endeavor, and I'm thankful that he'll be alongside me during our cleaning services, ensuring we deliver the best experience possible.",
